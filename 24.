Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of a pointer to a constant variable. The program should:
- Declare a constant variable and a pointer to it.
Show how you can read the value pointed to by the pointer, but not modify it.



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Declare a constant integer variable
    const int constantVar = 42;
    
    // Declare a pointer to a constant integer and point it to the constant variable
    const int* ptr = &constantVar;
    
    // Read and print the value pointed to by the pointer
    cout << "Value of constantVar through pointer: " << *ptr << endl;
    
    // Demonstrate that you cannot modify the value through the pointer
    // Uncommenting the line below would cause a compile error:
    // *ptr = 100;  // Error: assignment of read-only location '*ptr'
    
    // You can reassign the pointer to point to another constant or non-constant variable
    int anotherVar = 50;
    ptr = &anotherVar;
    cout << "Value of anotherVar through pointer: " << *ptr << endl;
    
    // Still cannot modify through the pointer, even if pointing to a non-const variable
    // *ptr = 60;  // Error: assignment of read-only location '*ptr'
    
    return 0;
}


output :

Value of constantVar through pointer: 42
Value of anotherVar through pointer: 50
