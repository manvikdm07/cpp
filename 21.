Swap Two Numbers Using Pointers
Write a C++ program that swaps two numbers using pointers. The program should:
- Declare two integer variables.
- Use a pointer to swap their values.
Print the swapped values.



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to swap two numbers using pointers
void swap(int* x, int* y) {
    int temp = *x;  // Store the value pointed to by x in temp
    *x = *y;        // Assign the value pointed to by y to the location pointed to by x
    *y = temp;      // Assign the temp value to the location pointed to by y
}

int main() {
    // Declare two integer variables
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    
    // Declare pointers to the variables
    int* ptrA = &a;
    int* ptrB = &b;
    
    // Print original values
    cout << "Before swap: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;
    
    // Swap the values using pointers
    swap(ptrA, ptrB);
    
    // Print swapped values
    cout << "After swap: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;
    
    return 0;
}



output :

Before swap: a = 5, b = 10
After swap: a = 10, b = 5
